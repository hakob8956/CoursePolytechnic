# Homework Demo

This is a test homework project and it relies on [this ProjectEuler](https://github.com/amuradyan/ProjectEulerPascal) repo.
It has the same structure, just the solutions section has been trimmed out.

One should implement the following four (interface) methods in `solutions.pas`

* `LargestPalindromeProduct: Int64`
* `LargestPrimeFactor(number: Int64): Int64`
* `EvenFibonacciNumbers: Int64`
* `MultiplesOf3And5: Int64;`
